% The FOM takes the form
% E*x' = [A*x+B*u+Bil(:,:,1)*x*u_1 + ... + Bil(:,:,m)*x*u_m]*dt + M*dW(t)
% %
% % E is NxN and is in these examples always the identity.
% % A is NxN and is the discretisation of the linear differential operator
% % B is Nxm and encodes the boundary conditions
% % Bil is NxNxm and is the collection of bilinear termns and is in these
% % examples always 0.
% % d is the dimension of the Wiener process
% % Diff is Nxd and corresponds to the spatial discretisation of the noise
% % K is dxd and specifies the correlation of the noise components
% % ind is a list of grid-indicies on which the solution is computed. this
% only not the full grid in the 2d Heat example.
